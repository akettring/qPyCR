qPyCR was developed based on the 2012 publication titled 
'Robust Quantification of Polymerase Chain Reactions Using Global Fitting' 
by Dr. Sean D. Moore and Anna Carr:

The original software implementation of the global fitter was developed for 
the University of Central Florida by Bioinformatics.org for online use and can be found here:
